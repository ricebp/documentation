Babies get imported to the “grad suggestions” tab of “[graduation and supplies return sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sfHtQanFG5i4fSfgVg7YL9YLRABvrGMeBSO5YtQdk7c/edit?gid=1322013560#gid=1322013560)” from the database when they reach 44W PMA, whether or not they meet the graduation criteria.

The managers must review the cases in “grad suggestions” and decide whether the project is going to: 



* continue working with the family 
* graduate the baby 
* recognize that the baby has health issues beyond the project’s ability to help and stop following the baby.


# Steps for using the grad suggestions sheet



1. The first thing a manager should do when working on graduations is to press “update.”
    1. This will look for new info and populate it
    2. It will also put the rows in the right order
2. When there is a row in “[grad suggestions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sfHtQanFG5i4fSfgVg7YL9YLRABvrGMeBSO5YtQdk7c/edit?gid=1322013560#gid=1322013560)” for which the “last staff reviewed” is “Automatic,” then the managers should look at the weight gain and the recent phone/home history for the baby, and put one of the following suggestions in column F (the “grad status” column).
    3. **grad:** Babies who meet the following criteria should be marked as “1”
        * gaining at least 15 gm per day for the most recent measured weights between 40 and 44 weeks PMA (Medical consensus is that babies between 40 and 44 weeks PMA should gain 20-30 grams per day.  In this context, many of the babies do not gain that much weight.  In the future, when the program is more developed, we will reconsider this cutoff, and whether there are additional steps we can take to help babies gain appropriate weight.)
        * are not sick
        * are not being fed animal milk
        * no longer being fed expressed breastmilk (unless they have cleft lip or palate)
        * are greater than 2500 grams (for babies with initial weight less than 1000, graduation weight is 2000 if all other criteria are met)
        * The program has collected a measured weight at or after 42 weeks PMA (column S should read “TRUE”) either through a phone call or home visit.
    4. **grad wt pending:** These are babies who meet the above criteria, but we do not have a weight at or after 42W PMA.  We are confident enough that they do not need a home visit from a nurse that we will send a staff member without medical training to pick up the scale and record the weight.  We ask the staff member to call the manager if he finds out a baby is sick when he picks up the scale.
    5. **still following:** These are babies who do not meet the above criteria, and we may be able to help them meet the criteria in the coming weeks.  The tools we have to do that are: 1) put them on priority calls, 2) ask them to come for an OPD visit, 3) do one or more home visits, 4) put them on special calls (calls from the managers).
    6. **HV:** These are babies for whom we don’t know if they meet the criteria, and we haven’t been able to reach them on the phone.  They may need help to meet the criteria, and they may not.  If a manager enters “4” she should populate the “[home visit-active](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vX4HleT9MG7R5rPvDMDCswJ4RJFnwFc1mXW8U57SiVw/edit?gid=232921398#gid=232921398)” tab and state the reason for doing the home visit.
    7. **“reached our limits”:**  These are babies who have reached 44 weeks PMA and do not meet the criteria, but the tools that the program has available (breastfeeding counseling and encouragement for OPD visits) are not sufficient to help the baby.  In the past, babies who have exited the program under this category at 44 weeks PMA have had hydrocephalus and congenital anomalies.

    Notes on Specific Graduate Actions:

1. A phone/home manager should review the cases and propose the category for each baby (1-5) described in **2** at regular intervals, according to the list of phone/home tasks.
2. A second manager then reviews the cases at regular intervals and take the following actions on each category of case:
    * If the 2nd manager agrees that the baby meets the criteria, (s)he should check the box in column A and press “action” to trigger the following actions in the following sheets and tabs:
    * Every row for that baby gets moved from [phone/home active](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zBLyy0ZqQxBwrSBWzhmylREhFjH2gWqVbdxaHQ5y0Oo/edit?gid=1168822823#gid=1168822823) to tab.
    * A new row with all static information for the ID gets added to the “supplies return” tab. The “reason for pickup” column is pre-filled as “grad.”  A list of latest baby care items is imported for the row.
    * The row for that baby in “grad suggestions” moves to the “[gr](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sfHtQanFG5i4fSfgVg7YL9YLRABvrGMeBSO5YtQdk7c/edit?gid=1415147730#gid=1415147730)ad [resolved](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sfHtQanFG5i4fSfgVg7YL9YLRABvrGMeBSO5YtQdk7c/edit?gid=1415147730#gid=1415147730)”.
3. If the second manager agrees the baby meets the criteria but no weight at or after 42 weeks is available, then (s)he should check the box in column A and press “action” to trigger the following actions.
    * The “date to follow up” column in the last row for that baby should be overwritten as “grad wt pending.”  The baby no longer receives calls, but the rows are not yet moved.
    * A row for the baby is generated in the supplies return tab and “reason for pickup” is “grad weight pending.”
    * All static information for the baby gets filled from the database
    * Column “reason for pickup” is pre-filled as “grad - wt pending” 
    * Latest baby care items are updated for the baby from the [basic information sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LcSu0xqt3WnfQ_qvtj7r8ULV8YU7WkkupQjH_ihP7UQ/edit?gid=1287213524#gid=1287213524)
    * The “status” in the grad suggestions tab changes to another number, “2a,” for *2-approved* so that the next time a manager comes to check on graduations she does not check it again.
4. Updating the clothes-free weight: If the baby has already graduated (the manager has taken action on codes 1 or 5), then the clothes free weight collected by the person who picks up the scale gets sent to the archive when it is entered through the [Home Visit Google Entry Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScyxj3b7I79J3cpwDuyqheg5NLsfxtlH1ra30MbKW-KOm4NOQ/viewform).  When the clothes free weight for the baby is entered through the home visit form, that data will get updated in the database as well, and then script that creates the list of babies who need graduation review will pick up the new weight.  Then, the system will turn the row yellow to remind the manager to review the baby for graduation again. If the baby meets the criteria, then the manager changes the status to another code (2b) and presses “action.” In this case, the “action” button would move all the rows of phone/home to [phone/home archive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13kb61HScq-i4Zj-QVaZn7Ob-ME7Fcc_vXdQ5Xv-Jst4/edit?gid=1168822823#gid=1168822823)) sheet, but not populate the supplies return tab.
5. There is no action associated with 3.  We are still following and working with this baby.  When new weights are recorded in the database, the baby’s row gets highlighted again.  If a row’s status is “3” and the baby is highlighted yellow when a manager reviews the shee, (s)he should check whether the baby now meets the graduation criteria. `
6. If a baby needs a home visit to graduate, the manager who performs the graduation review should press the “action” button after assigning the baby to “4.”  The baby should automatically be put on home visits with the same columns populated as the [home visit-active](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vX4HleT9MG7R5rPvDMDCswJ4RJFnwFc1mXW8U57SiVw/edit?gid=232921398#gid=232921398) tab import tool.
    * The manager will need to go over to the home visit active tab and add a date, the urgency, and the reason for HV. 
    * Pressing the action button should take no action in the phone/home active sheet.  The “status” column should get updated to “4a” to show that the action has been taken and we are awaiting the HV. 
    * When the home visit gets entered, the automatic update will pick up the new weight and the manager will review the case again.
    * If (s)he enters “4b” and takes action, then the rows should get moved to “[phone/home archive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13kb61HScq-i4Zj-QVaZn7Ob-ME7Fcc_vXdQ5Xv-Jst4/edit?gid=1168822823#gid=1168822823))” tab of the database, and the row in “[grad suggestions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sfHtQanFG5i4fSfgVg7YL9YLRABvrGMeBSO5YtQdk7c/edit?gid=1322013560#gid=1322013560)” should get archived.  But the row should NOT be added to the “[supplies return active](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sfHtQanFG5i4fSfgVg7YL9YLRABvrGMeBSO5YtQdk7c/edit?gid=1611690015#gid=1611690015)” because we assume the home visitor would have picked up the scale.
    * If the home visit form does not mention scale pick up by the nurse, the manager can add the scale pick up to the “supplies return” list by hand.
7. If the 2nd manager agrees that the baby meets the criteria for “reached our limits,” (s)he should check the box in column A and press “action” to trigger the following actions in the following sheets and tabs:
    * Change the “date to follow up” to “limit” so that we have a record of the status of the program exit type in the database.
    * Move the rows in [phone/home active](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zBLyy0ZqQxBwrSBWzhmylREhFjH2gWqVbdxaHQ5y0Oo/edit?gid=1168822823#gid=1168822823) to [phone/home archive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13kb61HScq-i4Zj-QVaZn7Ob-ME7Fcc_vXdQ5Xv-Jst4/edit?gid=1168822823#gid=1168822823))
    * Populate the “[supplies return active](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sfHtQanFG5i4fSfgVg7YL9YLRABvrGMeBSO5YtQdk7c/edit?gid=1611690015#gid=1611690015)” tab with the baby’s information, and write “limit” on the “reason for scale pickup”
    * Archive the row from “[grad suggestions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sfHtQanFG5i4fSfgVg7YL9YLRABvrGMeBSO5YtQdk7c/edit?gid=1322013560#gid=1322013560)**”**
